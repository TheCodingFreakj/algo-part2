Minimum Path Sum in a Grid: Given a grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner that minimizes the sum of numbers along the path.


Minimum Cost Path in a Matrix with Limited Moves: Given a matrix with values representing costs, and limited moves in each direction, find the minimum cost path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

Variations of above

Minimum Cost Path with Limited Moves and Obstacles: In this variation, the matrix contains obstacles or blocked cells that cannot be traversed. The task is to find the minimum cost path from a start cell to an end cell while only being allowed to move a certain number of steps in each direction (up, down, left, right).

or 

Minimum Cost Path with Limited Moves and Diagonal Moves: This variation introduces diagonal movement along with vertical and horizontal movements. The task is to find the minimum cost path from a start cell to an end cell, with restrictions on the maximum number of steps allowed in each direction, including diagonals.

or 

Minimum Cost Path with Limited Moves and Variable Step Costs: Here, the cost of moving from one cell to another may vary based on some conditions or parameters. The task is to find the path with the minimum total cost from a given start cell to an end cell, while considering the limited number of steps allowed in each direction and the variable costs associated with movement.

Or

Minimum Cost Path with Limited Moves and Weights: Here, each cell in the matrix has an associated cost or weight. The objective is to find the path with the minimum total cost from a given start cell to an end cell, while being constrained by the maximum number of steps allowed in each direction.



Minimum Cost Path in a Weighted Graph: Given a weighted graph, find the path from a given source vertex to a given destination vertex such that the total cost of the path is minimized.
