function findPath(grid, start, end):
    Initialize an empty queue.
    Enqueue the start cell into the queue.
    Initialize a set to keep track of visited cells.
    Add the start cell to the visited set.
    Initialize a dictionary to store parent pointers.
    Set parent of start cell to None.

    while queue is not empty:
        Dequeue a cell from the queue.
        If the dequeued cell is the destination:
            Reconstruct and return the path using parent pointers.
        For each neighbor of the dequeued cell:
            If neighbor is a valid cell (not blocked and not visited):
                Mark neighbor as visited.
                Add neighbor to the queue.
                Update parent pointer of neighbor to the dequeued cell.

    // If destination is unreachable
    Return an empty path.
